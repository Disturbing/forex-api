# Swagger generated server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This
is an example of building a swagger-enabled Flask server.

This example uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask.

## Requirements
Python 3.5.2+
Ensure the port you want to run on is defined in your environment as a variable named FOREX_PORT.

## Usage
To run the server, please execute the following from the root directory:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m swagger_server
```

and open your browser to here:

```
http://localhost:8080/forex/ui/
```

Your Swagger definition lives here:

```
http://localhost:8080/forex/swagger.json
```

To launch the integration tests, run pytest:
```
pytest
```

## Running with Docker

To run the server on a Docker container, please execute the following from the root directory:

```bash
# building the image
docker build --build-arg FOREX_PORT=$FOREX_PORT -t forex_server ./

# starting up a container
docker run -p $FOREX_PORT:$FOREX_PORT forex_server
```
